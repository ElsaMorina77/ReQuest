Description:
ReQuest is an interactive platform designed for users to seek assistance from a supportive community in locating unique items. Users can create an account, log in, and post their requests for specific items they are searching for or share discoveries they want others to find. The site fosters collaboration and connection among members, allowing users to help one another in their questing journeys.

Visitors can browse the Home page to view various requests posted by others, even without an account. All marked posts are highlighted in light green, making it easy to identify items that have been successfully found. ReQuest emphasizes the joy of discovery and the power of community, inviting users to embark on a rewarding questing experience.
